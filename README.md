## String Manipulation Programs.

## This repository contains Python programs for various string manipulations.

  ## Search Conditions in a String
  - [Python Program](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/search.py)
  - [Pytest Program](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/test_search.py)
       * The program searches for the following patterns in a given string:
         - 1.%sh
         - 2.sh%
         - 3.vi%li
  ## Search and Replace "Visha" in a String
  - [Python Code](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/replace_null.py)
  - [Pytest Code](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/test_replace_null.py)
       * This program searches for the string "Visha" in a given string and replaces it with an empty string.
  ## Remove Digits from a Text File
  - [Python Code](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/remove_digit.py)
      * [python.txt file - Original File](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/python.txt)
      * [python1.txt file - Removed Digits File](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/python1.txt)
  - [Pytest Code](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/test_remove_digit.py)
       * This program reads a text file named "PYTHON.TXT," removes all numbers or digits from its content, and writes the modified 
        content to a new file named "PYTHON1.TXT."
  ## Count Words in a Text File
  - [Python Code](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/count_words.py)
       * [Count words from this file](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/python.txt)
  - [Pytest Code](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/test_count_words.py) 
       * This program reads a text file and returns the count of words in the file.
  ## Read a File to List
  - [Python Code](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/file_to_lst.py)
  - [Pytest Code](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/test_file_lst.py) 
       * This program reads the content of a text file and stores it in a list.
  ## Read a File into Dictionary
  - [Python Code](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/file_to_dict.py)
      * [dict.txt file - Text file to be read into dictionary](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/dict.txt)
      * [dict1.txt file - Text file to be read into dictionary](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/dict1.txt)
  - [Pytest Code](https://github.com/VismayaM-2003/Assignment3/blob/main/test_dict.py)
       * This program reads the content of a text file, assuming it contains key-value pairs, and stores it in a dictionary.
