       * This program reads a text file named "PYTHON.TXT," removes all numbers or digits from its content, and writes the modified 
        content to a new file named "PYTHON1.TXT."
  - [Count Words in a Text File](#4-count-words-in-a-text-file)
       * This program reads a text file and returns the count of words in the file.
  - [Read a File to List](#5-read-a-file-to-list)
       * This program reads the content of a text file and stores it in a list.
  - [Read a File into Dictionary](#6-read-a-file-into-dictionary)
       * This program reads the content of a text file, assuming it contains key-value pairs, and stores it in a dictionary.
